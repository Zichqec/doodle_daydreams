	"\b[0]Taking care of my weapon is a top priority, whatever that weapon may be. You cannot %(slayademon) with a %(rustedsword)!"
	"\b[0]Every day is the chance to begin a new story. Mine will be %(legendary)!"
	"\b[0]You can never be too prepared. I train every day to keep my body strong, my mind sharp, and my outfits on point."
	"\b[2]After a tough battle, it's important to take time to heal and get back to your best. It can be challenging when it takes longer than I would like... but patience is a requirement for success!"
	"\b[4]When fighting a dragon, the most significant thing to keep in mind is that they are intelligent creatures. Whether%(br)they're predators or not, they've managed to survive and grow long enough to be worthy of a quest. This is not done on strength alone! They cannot be underestimated."
	"\b[2]An adventurer always needs to be on guard. You think that's %(achest)?\n\n Wrong! It's a mimic, and it just %(killedyou)."
	"\b[4]Bad breath can be deadly on the road. Dire boars don't even know what a toothbrush is.\n\n Imagine rolling over at night and getting hot, stinky breath all over your face. You'd be done for! Dead on the spot! It happened to me once."
	"\b[2]Delving into dungeons can take longer than you expect. Sometimes long enough that you need to get creative with your meals. Be careful, though! Not all %(wallscums) are safe... "
	"\b[4]There are a lot of interesting people on the road. You can learn more than you would expect from helping out wherever you can.\n\n Still, it helps if you can tell when you're dealing with %(avampire).\n\n Things can get awkward otherwise... "
	"\b[6]Watch out, there's %(avampire) on the loose! Citizens, get to the nearest shelter!"
	"\b[0]Never underestimate the weather! Adventuring is easy when it's sunny and warm, but you must prepare for rain and snow, too!"
	"\b[6]Rain or shine, nothing shall stop me from %(scalingthismountain)!"
	"\b[6]Nothing could be better than eating a hearty meal by a campfire after a hard day of adventuring!"
	"\b[0]Adventurers face many trials on the open road, but you'll seldom meet one that doesn't relish the challenge!"
	"\b[0]Never stop moving forward. You never know, around the next bend might be %(atreasurechest)!"
	"\b[2]Don't forget to watch the skies. Aerial monsters will snatch you in an instant.\n\n Once you're off the ground, you're in \f[bold,true]their\f[bold,default] domain, and a defeat is sure to follow."
	"\b[2]Before you take a job from the local town, be sure to find out if other adventurers before you have attempted it and perished!\n\n Learn from their mistakes, so you don't make the same ones."
	"\b[2]When facing down a cyclops, the most important thing to remember is this:\n\n A lack of depth perception doesn't matter when its club is the size of a tree!"
	"\b[6]Off on another adventure! What grand tale awaits?"
	"\b[6]There, behind the rocks! %(Capitalize(avampire))!"
	"\b[6]Be careful near %(thecliffedge)!"
	"\b[6]The trick to defeating %(avampire)? %(Capitalize(staylightonyourfeet))!"
	"\b[0]Another job well done! Now it's off to %(theblacksmith)!"
	"\b[6]Walk confidently, it deters monsters and thieves alike!"
	"\b[0]Don't neglect to practice your heroic poses; many a battle is won through intimidation before %(asingleswordhasswung)!"
	"\b[6]Never take your eyes off %(yourtarget)!"
	"\b[0]To be an adventurer is to go where others won't go, do what others won't do, and %(bethehero)!"
	"\b[0]Be the change you wish to see in the world! Have %(avampire) problem? Make it your mission to exterminate their kind!"
	"\b[6]Hold %(yoursword) aloft and wield it with pride!"
	"\b[0]An adventurer has no use for fear. %(Capitalize(jumpintothecanyon)) with wild abandon!"
	"\b[6]If you can't %(landthekillingblow), you need more practice!"
	"\b[2]Above all else, an adventurer must be curious, brave, and charismatic.\n\n %(Capitalize(havingasword)) helps, too!"
	"\b[0]Don't let %(asprainedankle) hold you back! Get yourself to the apothecary, then back on the road!"
	"\b[6]When all else is going wrong, rely on %(yourtrustysword)!"
	"\b[2]It's important to take a break now and then to let one's mind and body relax.\n\n %(Capitalize(atriptothesauna)) is good for the soul!"
	"\b[6]The %(monster) is slain! Back to town for our well-deserved reward."
	"\b[6]I'll see to it that the %(monster) never terrorizes this village ever again!"
	"\b[6]Lets go, that mountain won't scale itself!"
	"\b[6]Not far now, keep going!"
	"\b[6]Step lightly, or you'll wake the %(monster)."
	"\b[0]Watch where you step! One wrong footfall this far up could send you plummeting to your doom."
	"\b[2]If you're going to forage for food, make sure to spend time learning about plants!\n\n Many tasty looking berries and mushrooms are deadly within days of consumption... "
	"\b[2]Watch out for spider webs! A small web on its own is harmless, but if you see large webs or many webs gathered together, proceed with caution!"
	"\b[0]Always bring more food than you think you'll need. You never know when you might get stuck in a cave for a few days longer than planned!"
	"\b[0]A good way to trick your enemies in to letting their guard down is to %(pretendyoureafraid)!"
	"\b[6]Get to know your equipment and how to maintain it for best results!"
	"\b[2]Make sure to regularly check your skin for %(leeches)!\n\n That includes taking your boots off and checking your feet!"
	"\b[6]The %(king) is sure to give us a handsome reward!"
	"\b[6]Come, our next adventure awaits!"

	"\b[4]Have you ever wished you could go on a romantic date with the person in the mirror?\n\n I have. I find them to be quite charming. However,\w4%(br)each time I try to invite them, we always end up speaking over each other... How embarrassing."
	"\b[0]I always bring my %(paperfan) to a soir√©e. It wouldn't do to be caught without in an emergency."
