	"\b[0]You can never be too prepared. I train every day to keep my body strong, my mind sharp, and my outfits on point."
	"\b[2]After a tough battle, it's important to take time to heal and get back to your best. It can be challenging when it takes longer than I would like... but patience is a requirement for success!"
	"\b[4]When fighting a dragon, the most significant thing to keep in mind is that they are intelligent creatures. Whether%(br)they're predators or not, they've managed to survive and grow long enough to be worthy of a quest. This is not done on strength alone! They cannot be underestimated."
	"\b[2]An adventurer always needs to be on guard. You think that's %(achest)?\n\n Wrong! It's a mimic, and it just %(killedyou)."
	"\b[4]Bad breath can be deadly on the road. Dire boars don't even know what a toothbrush is.\n\n Imagine rolling over at night and getting hot, stinky breath all over your face. You'd be done for! Dead on the spot! It happened to me once."
	"\b[2]Delving into dungeons can take longer than you expect. Sometimes long enough that you need to get creative with your meals. Be careful, though! Not all %(wallscums) are safe... "
	"\b[4]There are a lot of interesting people on the road. You can learn more than you would expect from helping out wherever you can.\n\n Still, it helps if you can tell when you're dealing with %(avampire).\n\n Things can get awkward otherwise... "
	"\b[6]Watch out, there's %(avampire) on the loose! Citizens, get to the nearest shelter!"
	"\b[0]Never underestimate the weather! Adventuring is easy when it's sunny and warm, but you must prepare for rain and snow, too!"
	"\b[6]Rain or shine, nothing shall stop me from %(scalingthismountain)!"
	"\b[6]Nothing could be better than eating a hearty meal by a campfire after a hard day of adventuring!"
	"\b[0]Adventurers face many trials on the open road, but you'll seldom meet one that doesn't relish the challenge!"
	"\b[0]Never stop moving forward. You never know, around the next bend might be %(atreasurechest)!"
	"\b[2]Don't forget to watch the skies. Aerial monsters will snatch you in an instant.\n\n Once you're off the ground, you're in \f[italic,true]their\f[italic,default] domain, and a defeat is sure to follow."
	"\b[2]Before you take a job from the local town, be sure to find out if other adventurers before you have attempted it and perished!\n\n Learn from their mistakes, so you don't make the same ones."
	"\b[0]When facing down a cyclops, the most important thing to remember is this:\n\n A lack of depth perception doesn't matter when its club is the size of a tree!"
